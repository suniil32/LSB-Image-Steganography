Steganography Project: LSB Image Steganography

Overview
The project involves implementing Least Significant Bit (LSB) Image Steganography, a widely used method for concealing information within digital images. Steganography is the practice of hiding a message or data within another medium, such as images, audio, or video, in a way that prevents detection. This technique is commonly applied in data security, watermarking, and covert communication.

Objective
The main goal is to develop a system capable of:

Embedding secret data (e.g., text or binary files) within an image by altering the least significant bits of its pixel values.
Extracting the hidden data from the steganographic image without compromising the visual quality of the original image.
Key Features

Data Embedding:

Modify the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image's pixel values (RGB or grayscale) to encode the secret message.
Maintain minimal distortion to the visual quality of the image.
Data Extraction:

Accurately retrieve the embedded data by reversing the embedding process.
Encryption Integration (Optional):

Add an encryption step for the secret message before embedding, enhancing security.
User Interface:

Develop a simple command-line interface or GUI for ease of use.
Technical Details

Programming Language:

The implementation is done in C/C++ for optimal performance and control over pixel manipulation.
Algorithm:

LSB Substitution: Replace the least significant bit of each pixel with a bit from the secret data.

Example:
Pixel Value (Binary): 10101100
Secret Data Bit: 1
Modified Pixel Value: 10101101
Utilize a key to specify the starting pixel or define the embedding pattern for enhanced security.

Input/Output:

Input: Cover image (carrier image), secret message/file.
Output: Stego image with embedded data, extracted message after decoding.
Error Handling:

Implement checks for image size and message length compatibility to prevent data overflow.
Image Formats:

Focus on common image formats like BMP or PNG due to their uncompressed or lossless nature, preserving data integrity.
Challenges

Balancing data capacity and image quality to ensure minimal detectable changes.
Ensuring compatibility with various image formats.
Preventing data loss during extraction.
Applications

Secure communication to transmit confidential information covertly.
Watermarking for digital copyright protection.
Forensics and intelligence for hidden data retrieval.
Future Scope

Extending the project to support audio and video steganography.
Incorporating machine learning to detect steganographic manipulations.
Improving robustness against image compression or manipulation.
