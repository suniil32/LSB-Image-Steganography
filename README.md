Address Book Project

Overview
The Address Book project is a console-based or graphical application that allows users to manage and organize their personal or professional contacts. It includes functionality to store, retrieve, update, and delete contact information, offering a user-friendly solution for personal data management. This project is ideal for learning about file handling, data structures, and database management.

Objective
To develop a robust Address Book system with essential features to:

Add new contact information.
Search for specific contacts using different criteria.
Edit or delete existing contact details.
Save and retrieve contacts from persistent storage.
Key Features

Add Contacts:

Store contact details like name, phone number, email, address, and other optional fields (e.g., birthday, company).
Validate inputs such as phone number format or email structure.
Search Contacts:

Search by name, phone number, email, or custom fields.
Implement fuzzy search for partial matches.
Update Contacts:

Modify specific fields of an existing contact.
Delete Contacts:

Remove unwanted or outdated entries from the address book.
List All Contacts:

Display all saved contacts in a user-friendly format.
Include sorting options (e.g., alphabetically or by recent addition).
Persistence:

Save contacts in a file (e.g., text file, CSV, JSON, or SQLite database) for long-term storage.
Load contacts automatically at startup.
Export/Import Contacts (Optional):

Enable exporting contacts to external formats (CSV, vCard).
Allow importing existing contacts from files.
User Interface:

Provide a simple text-based menu or graphical interface for interacting with the address book.
Technical Details

Programming Language:

Implemented in C or C++ for learning purposes.
Data Structure:

Use arrays or linked lists for temporary in-memory storage.
Optionally use a hash table or binary search tree for efficient searching.
File Handling:

Use file I/O operations to save and retrieve contact data in plain text, CSV, or JSON format.
Provide error handling for file operations.
Database (Optional):

Use SQLite or any lightweight database for persistent and structured storage.
Modular Approach:

Separate the application into modules, such as input handling, file management, and contact operations.
Example Workflow

User opens the application.

A menu displays options:

Add Contact
Search Contact
Edit Contact
Delete Contact
List Contacts
Exit
The user selects an operation, performs the action, and receives feedback.

On exiting, contacts are saved to a file or database for persistence.

Challenges

Designing an efficient search and sort mechanism for a growing list of contacts.
Handling file format compatibility for export/import features.
Ensuring data integrity during file operations or crashes.
Applications

Personal organization of contacts.
Small-scale customer management for businesses.
Learning foundational programming concepts like file handling and data manipulation.
Future Scope

Cloud Integration: Sync contacts with online storage or services like Google Contacts.
Advanced Features: Add reminders for birthdays or anniversaries.
Mobile/GUI App: Develop a mobile or desktop application with an intuitive interface.
